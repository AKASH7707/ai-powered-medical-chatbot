It has the fastest induction and\\nrecovery and is the safest because it does not slow\\nbreathing or blood flow to the brain. However, it diffus-\\nes rapidly into air-containing cavities and can result in a\\ncollapsed lung ( pneumothorax ) or lower the oxygen\\ncontents of tissues (hypoxia).\\nCommonly administered intravenous anesthetic\\nagents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and propofol.\\n• Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces a\\ndissociative anesthesia (catatonia, amnesia, analgesia)\\nin which the patient may appear awake and reactive, but\\ncannot respond to sensory stimuli. These properties\\nmake it especially useful for use in developing coun-\\ntries and during warfare medical treatment. Ketamine is\\nfrequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesia\\nand analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscular\\ninjection. It is also used in high-risk geriatric patients\\nand in shock cases, because it also provides cardiac\\nstimulation.\\n• Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces a\\nrapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because thiopen-\\ntal is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic accumula-\\ntion can occur; therefore, it should not be continuously\\ninfused. Side effects include nausea and vomiting\\nupon awakening.\\n• Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, and\\nare frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as a\\nsedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusion\\nfor primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affect\\nthe cardiovascular system, they are particularly useful\\nfor cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioids\\nact directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqently\\nused in epidurals for spinal anesthesia. Side effects may\\ninclude nausea and vomiting, itching, and respiratory\\ndepression.\\n• Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agent\\nand the most recently developed intravenous anesthetic.\\nIts rapid induction and short duration of action are iden-\\ntical to thiopental, but recovery occurs more quickly\\nand with much less nausea and vomiting. Also, propo-\\nfol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in\\nthe urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes-\\nthesia, unlike thiopental. Hence, propofol is rapidly\\nreplacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agent.\\nIt is used for general surgery , cardiac surgery, neuro-\\nsurgery, and pediatric surgery.\\nGeneral anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo-\\ngists, the medical professionals trained to use them. These\\nspecialists consider many factors, including a patient’s\\nage, weight, medication allergies, medical history, and\\ngeneral health, when deciding which anesthetic or combi-\\nnation of anesthetics to use. General anesthetics are usual-\\nly inhaled through a mask or a breathing tube or injected\\ninto a vein, but are also sometimes given rectally.\\nGeneral anesthesia is much safer today than it was in\\nthe past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics,\\nimproved safety standards in the equipment used to\\ndeliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breath-\\ning, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity during\\nsurgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the\\npatient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgery\\nor medical procedure being done, and other medication\\nthe patient takes before, during, or after surgery.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the risks of serious complications from\\ngeneral anesthesia are very low, they can include heart\\nattack, stroke, brain damage, and death. Anyone sched-\\nuled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughly\\ndiscuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risks\\nof complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex,\\nweight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking,\\ndrinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can be\\nminimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi-\\nologist are fully informed of the detailed health condition\\nof the patient, including any drugs that he or she may be\\nusing. Older people are especially sensitive to the effects\\nof certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi-\\nence side effects from these drugs.\\nPatients who have had general anesthesia should not\\ndrink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slow\\ndown the central nervous system (such as antihista-\\nmines, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain\\nrelievers, muscle relaxants, and anti-seizure medication)\\nfor at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions are at greater\\nrisk of developing problems with anesthetics. Before\\nundergoing general anesthesia, anyone with the follow-\\ning conditions should absolutely inform their doctor.\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had allergic or other\\nunusual reactions to barbiturates or general anesthetics\\nin the past should notify the doctor before having general\\nanesthesia.

DSM-IV notes that unlike manic episodes, hypoman-\\nic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in social\\nor occupational functioning, do not require hospitaliza-\\ntion, and do not have psychotic features. In addition,\\nbecause hypomanic episodes are characterized by high\\nenergy and goal directed activities and often result in a\\npositive outcome, or are perceived in a positive manner\\nby the patient, bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed.\\nBipolar symptoms often present differently in chil-\\ndren and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age groups\\nare typically characterized by more psychotic features\\nthan in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz-\\nophrenia. Children and adolescents also tend toward irri-\\ntability and aggressiveness instead of elation. Further,\\nsymptoms tend to be chronic, or ongoing, rather than\\nacute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted,\\nimpulsive, and hyperactive, which can lead to a misdiag-\\nnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\\nFurthermore, their aggression often leads to violence,\\nwhich may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder.\\nSubstance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of pre-\\nscription or over-the-counter medication can mask or\\nmimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of sub-\\nstance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a peri-\\nod of detoxification and abstinence before a mood disor-\\nder is diagnosed and treatment begins.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of bipolar disorder is usually by means of\\nmedication. A combination of mood stabilizing agents\\nwith antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants\\nis used to regulate manic and depressive episodes.\\nMood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carba-\\nmazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate the\\nmanic highs and lows of bipolar disorder:\\n• Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid,\\nLithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most fre-\\nquently prescribed drugs available for the treatment of\\nbipolar mania and depression. Because the drug takes\\nfour to ten days to reach a therapeutic level in the blood-\\nstream, it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction with\\nneuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines to provide more\\nimmediate relief of a manic episode. Lithium has also\\nbeen shown to be effective in regulating bipolar depres-\\nsion, but is not recommended for mixed mania. Lithium\\nmay not be an effective long-term treatment option for\\nrapid cyclers, who typically develop a tolerance for it, or\\nmay not respond to it. Possible side effects of the drug\\ninclude weight gain, thirst, nausea, and hand tremors.\\nProlonged lithium use may also cause hyperthyroidism\\n(a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart palpita-\\ntions, nervousness, the presence of goiter, sweating,\\nand a wide array of other symptoms.)\\n• Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant\\ndrug usually prescribed in conjunction with other mood\\nstabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treat bipo-\\nlar patients who have not responded well to lithium\\ntherapy. Blurred vision and abnormal eye movement\\nare two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapy.\\nAs of early 1998, carbamazepine did not have an FDA-\\ncleared indication for mania.\\n• Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic\\nacid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available that\\nhas been proven effective in treating rapid cycling bipo-\\nlar and mixed states patients. Valproate is prescribed\\nalone or in combination with carbamazepine and/or lithi-\\num. Stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea, hair loss,\\nappetite loss, nausea, and unusual weight loss or gain are\\nsome of the common side effects of valproate. Note: val-\\nproate is also approved for the treatment of mania.\\nBecause antidepressants may stimulate manic\\nepisodes in some bipolar patients, their use is typically\\nshort-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs) or, less often, monoamine oxidase inhibitors\\n(MAO inhibitors) are prescribed for episodes of bipolar\\ndepression. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipo-\\nlar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolar\\npatients and are, therefore, not a preferred treatment\\noption for bipolar depression.\\n• SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft),\\nand paroxetine (Paxil), regulate depression by regulating\\nlevels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Anxiety, diarrhea,\\ndrowsiness, headache, sweating, nausea, sexual prob-\\nlems, and insomniaare all possible side effects of SSRIs.\\n• MAOIs such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenel-\\nzine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase\\n(MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system.\\nPatients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine\\n(found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet to\\navoid hypotensive side effects.\\n• Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a heterocyclic antidepres-\\nsant. The exact neurochemical mechanism of the drug\\nis not known, but it has been effective in regulating\\nbipolar depression in some patients. Side effects of\\nbupropion include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor,\\ndry mouth , fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, and\\ninsomnia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 487\\nBipolar disorder\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 487'),\n",

The\\nreconstructed breast cannot be exactly like the original.\\nThe first step is to form a structure called a breast\\nmound. This can be accomplished using artificial materials\\ncalled breast implants, or by using tissues from other parts\\nof the woman’s body. The second step involves creating a\\nbalance between the newly constructed breast and the\\nbreast on the opposite side. The nipple and areolar complex\\n(darker area around the nipple) are recreated. This is usual-\\nly done several months after the mound is created, to allow\\nswelling to go down. Other procedures may be necessary,\\nsuch as lifting the opposite breast (mastopexy), or making\\nit larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast.\\nTiming, immediate or delayed reconstruction\\nWhile immediate reconstruction (IR) is not recom-\\nmended for women with breast cancer who need to under-\\ngo other, more important treatments, breast reconstruction\\ncan be done almost anytime. It even can be done during the\\nsame procedure as the mastectomy, or it can be delayed.\\nThere are psychological benefits to IR. The ability to return\\nto normal activities and routines is often enhanced when\\nreconstruction follows immediately after mastectomy. A\\nbetter appearance may result from IR. There is less skin\\nremoval, often resulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon is\\nbetter able to preserve the normal boundaries of the breast,\\nso it is easier to match the opposite breast more closely.\\nThe cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of\\ndelayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer opera-\\ntion and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for a\\ncombined procedure than for two separate surgeries.\\nThere are disadvantages of IR as well. The surgery\\nitself is longer, causing more time under anesthesia.\\nPost-operative pain and recovery time will be greater\\nthan for mastectomy alone.\\nOther authorities contend that delayed reconstruc-\\ntion (DR) offers different physical and psychological\\nadvantages. The initial mastectomy procedure alone\\ntakes less time, and has a shorter recovery period and less\\npain than mastectomy and IR. The patient has more time\\nto adjust to her diagnosis and recover from additional\\ntherapy. She is better able to research her options, and to\\nformulate realistic goals for reconstruction. Some recon-\\nstructive surgery requires blood transfusions. With DR,\\nthe patient can donate her own blood ahead of time\\n(autologous transfusion), and/or arrange to have family\\nand friends donate blood for her use (directed donation).\\nThe psychological stress of living without a breast is\\na disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR entails\\nresults in higher costs. Although initial recovery is faster,\\nan additional recuperation period is required after the\\ndelayed operation.\\nType of reconstruction\\nThere are two basic choices for breast reconstruc-\\ntion. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant or\\nthe breast is created using some of the woman’s own tis-\\nsues (autologous reconstruction).\\nARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS. In general, implant proce-\\ndures take less time, and are less expensive than autolo-\\ngous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches. They are\\nmade of silicone outer shells, which may be smooth or\\ntextured. The inside may contain silicone gel, saline (salt\\nwater), or a combination of both.\\nAn implant may be a fixed volume type, which can-\\nnot change its size. Implants that have the capacity to be\\nfilled after insertion are called tissue expanders. These\\nmay be temporary or permanent.\\nThe initial procedure for any implant insertion uses\\nthe mastectomy incision to make a pocket of tissue, usu-\\nally underneath the chest wall muscle. In DR, the mas-\\ntectomy scar may be re opened and used for this purpose,\\nor a more cosmetic incision may be made. The implant is\\ninserted into the pocket, the skin is stretched as needed\\nand stitched closed.\\nIf there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired size,\\nor a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue expander is\\nused. It resembles a partially deflated balloon, with an\\nattached valve or port through which saline can be injected.\\nAfter the initial surgical incision is healed, the woman\\nreturns to the doctor’s office, on a weekly or bi-weekly\\nbasis, to have small amounts of saline injected. Injections\\ncan continue for about six to eight weeks, until the preferred\\nsize is obtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and later\\npartially deflated to allow for a more pliable, natural result.\\nA temporary tissue expander will be removed after several\\nmonths and replaced with a permanent implant.\\nIR surgery using an implant takes approximately\\ntwo to three hours, and usually requires up to a three day\\nhospital stay. Implant insertion surgery, as part of DR,\\ntakes one to two hours and can sometimes be done as an\\noutpatient, or it or it may entail overnight hospitalization.\\nAUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION. Attached flap and\\nfree flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s tissue\\nis used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses skin, mus-\\ncle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to their origi-\\nnal source of blood. The flap is maneuvered to the recon-\\nstruction site, keeping its original blood supply for nour-\\nishment. This may also be known as a pedicle flap. The\\nsecond kind of surgery is called a free flap. This also uses\\nskin, muscle, and fat, but severs the blood vessels, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 587\\nBreast reconstruction\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 587')]"
